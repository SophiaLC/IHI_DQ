#' Visit-Arrival Lag
#'
#' @description 
#' Calculates the average time lag between when: a patient arrives and the first record for their visit is received by the Platform.
#' A summary is returned at the facility level.
#' 
#' @param data The raw data on which you will do these summaries.
#' @param names A table of Facility_Name and C_Facility_ID which taken from the MFT using the `pull_data` function.
#' @param offset The number of hours you wish to offset Arrived_Date_Time (which is in UTC). The offset value is how far off your local time zone is from UTC. 
#' For example, the Central Time Zone would set this to 5 or 6, depending on if it is daylight savings or not. This value should be an integer. 
#' @return A data frame with three columns: facility name, facility ID, and average lag between patient visit and first record arrival.
